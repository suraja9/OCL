- **Middleware:** JWT verification and admin route protection
- **API:** RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Routing:** React Router with protected routes
- **UI:** Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State:** Local state management with React hooks
- **API:** Fetch API with proper error handling

## üìä Database Collections

### Admins Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: String (unique),
  password: String (hashed),
  name: String,
  role: String (admin|super_admin),
  isActive: Boolean,
  lastLogin: Date,
  loginCount: Number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Address Forms Collection (existing)

   - Secure token verification middleware
   - Automatic logout on token expiration

3. **Route Protection**
   - All admin routes require valid JWT token
   - Frontend route protection with redirect to login
   - Backend middleware validates admin status

4. **Input Validation**
   - Server-side validation for all inputs
   - Client-side form validation
   - SQL injection prevention with Mongoose

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### Managing Address Forms
1. Navigate to the "Address Forms" tab
2. Use search bar to find specific forms
3. Filter by completion status or state
4. Click expand button (‚ñº) to view full details
5. Use Edit button to modify form data
6. Use Delete button to remove forms (with confirmation)
7. Export data using the "Export CSV" button

### Managing Pincodes
1. Navigate to the "Pincode Management" tab
2. Click "Add Pincode" to create new entries
3. Use search to find specific pincodes
4. Filter by state or city
5. Edit existing pincodes using the Edit button
6. Delete pincodes using the Delete button (with confirmation)
7. Export pincode data using "Export CSV"

### Dashboard Overview
- View total forms, completion rates, and statistics
- Monitor recent form submissions
- Track top states by activity
- Real-time data updates

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow:**
   Admin Login ‚Üí JWT Token ‚Üí Protected Routes ‚Üí Dashboard Access

2. **Form Management Flow:**
   Dashboard ‚Üí Address Forms Tab ‚Üí Search/Filter ‚Üí View/Edit/Delete

3. **Pincode Management Flow:**
   Dashboard ‚Üí Pincode Tab ‚Üí Add/Edit/Delete ‚Üí Database Updates

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Issues**
   - Ensure backend server is running on port 5000
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify default admin account was created

2. **Data Loading Issues**
   - Check network connection
   - Verify API proxy configuration in vite.config.ts
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Permission Issues**
   - Ensure admin token is valid and not expired
   - Check admin account status (isActive = true)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

- Pagination implemented for large datasets (10 items per page)
- Search queries optimized with MongoDB indexes
- CSV export limited to reasonable data sizes
- JWT tokens cached in localStorage for session persistence
- Lazy loading of dashboard components

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Role-based permissions (admin vs super_admin)
2. Audit logging for admin actions
3. Bulk operations for forms and pincodes
4. Advanced filtering and sorting options
5. Dashboard charts and analytics
6. Email notifications for admin actions
7. Two-factor authentication
8. Admin user management interface
